A **curated list** of free-to-play games on Steam – no quality guarantees, no endorsements, just pure listings by a broke, unemployed Vietnamese dev with way too much free time.

Updates? Whenever boredom hits (or GitHub Actions runs daily). Stats (reviews, players, etc.) fresh from Steam API. Manual notes/safe ratings by a noob who only plays Easy/Normal mode.

**Powered ~70% by Grok (my AI buddy from xAI)** – fetching data, writing code/docs, keeping this repo alive while I procrastinate.

**Wallet safe (for now). Play at your own risk.**

### Quick Links
- [All Games](games/all-games.md) – Full list with thumbnails, stats, and noob notes.
- [By Genre](games/) – Separate files (FPS, MOBA, etc.) for easy browsing.
- [Top Online Games](games/top-online.md) – Realtime player count for multiplayer gems (or ghosts).

### Why This Exists
I'm jobless, introvert max level, Steam library 400+ (80% sale under $10). Needed a clean F2P list without digging Steam every time "hôm nay chơi free cái gì đây". So... this repo was born. Contributions welcome – save me from myself.

**Disclaimer:** Quality? Fun? Safety? Who knows. I only vouch for games I've played (check "Safe" column: y = yes, ? = dunno, ! = careful, n = nope). Problems? Talk to Valve/devs, not me.

### Contribute
1. Fork & add games to `scripts/data.json` (follow format).
2. Set manual fields: `notes`, `safe`, `type_game` ("online"/"offline"), `genre` if needed.
3. PR – I'll review when caffeine kicks in.
