A **curated list** of free-to-play games on Steam – no quality guarantees, no endorsements, just pure listings by a
broke, unemployed Vietnamese dev with too much free time and a Steam library full of sale games (80% under $10).

Updates? Daily auto via GitHub Actions (fresh stats, thumbnails, reviews sort best first). Manual notes/safe ratings by
a noob who only plays Easy/Normal mode – life's hard enough.

**Powered ~70% by Grok (my AI buddy from xAI)** – fetching data, fixing bugs, writing code/docs while I procrastinate.

**Wallet safe (for now). Play at your own risk.**

### Quick Links

- [All Games](games/all-games.md) – Full list sorted by reviews (best first), with thumbnails + noob notes.
- [By Genre](games/) – Separate files for easy browsing (FPS, MOBA, etc.).
- [Top Online Games](games/top-online.md) – Realtime player count for multiplayer (hot or ghost town?).

### Why This Exists

Unemployed, introvert max level, dropped out uni year 3, mooching off family. Needed a clean F2P list without digging
Steam every time "hôm nay chơi free cái gì đây". So this repo was born – hobby project of a "barely competent" dev
bumped by AI.

Contributions welcome – add games, fix bugs, save me from myself :))

**Disclaimer:** Quality? Fun? Safety? Who knows. I only vouch for games I've played (Safe column: y = yes, ? =
dunno, ! = careful, n = nope). Problems? Talk to Valve/devs, not me.

### Contribute

1. Fork & edit `scripts/data.json` (add games, set notes/safe/type_game/genre).
2. Push – tables auto regenerate immediate.
3. Open PR if big changes.
