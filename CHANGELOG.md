## [v1.1.0] - 2025-12-30 (Scale Noob Edition)

### Added

- Split all-games.md into parts when >200 games (part1, part2...) – mobile friendly, no more endless scroll hell.
- Smarter fetch: Skip games with full info (reviews/players/developer/etc.) – faster daily update, less Steam throttle
  risk.
- Full Wiki (English, noob friendly) – Home, FAQ, Code Explanation, Test Branch troll, Future Plans (you guess?), etc.
- More issue templates: Delete Games + Feedback/Rant – clean garbage + stress reliefrepo "like shit".
- CONTRIBUTING.md updated – "so easy" with issue forms.

### Improved

- Tables robust more (safe fallback name/thumbnail, no KeyError crash Action).
- Fetch batch + delay optimize – scale 500+ games ok, good, no timeout die.

### Fixed

- Various Action trolls (no commit clean, closed file, Unknown spam) – thanks Grok buddy fix 99%.

Thanks contributors (if any :))) ) – this broke unemployed dev appreciates stars + coffee donate.

Previous: [v1.0.0] – Initial stable, auto tables, templates, donate?.

Made with boredom, instant noodles, sale addiction, and Grok power ✨
