### Additional Notes from the Broke, Unemployed Maintainer (a.k.a. Me):
- **No quality guarantees whatsoever.** Most games on this list are just scraped/added because they're marked free-to-play on Steam. I only kinda-sorta vouch for the ones I've actually played (check the "Personal Experience" or "Safe?" column if it exists – my standards are low anyway).
- **Problems with a game?** Bugs, pay-to-win hell, toxic community, crashes, whatever – that's between you, Valve/Steam, and the developers. Do NOT contact me. I'm literally just a guy making a list while procrastinating on life.
- **Completeness & Accuracy:** This list is **DEFINITELY NOT 100% complete or accurate**. Games change status, get delisted, go paid, or die overnight. I miss stuff. Deal with it.
- **Malware/Viruses/Safety:** Who knows? Steam is generally safe, but I'm not your antivirus. I'll try to add a column/note for games I've personally played and think are clean(ish), but scan everything yourself. No promises.
- **Updates?** Whenever I feel like it. Daily? Every 3 days? Weekly? When boredom hits level 100 and caffeine kicks in. No schedule, no promises. This is a hobby project by a jobless introvert, not a corporation.
- **Thinking of suing me?** Lmao, good luck. I'm broke, have zero assets except a Steam library full of sale games, and this is literally just a curated list. You'd get more value farming achievements in the games listed here.
