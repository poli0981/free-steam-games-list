# TERMS OF USE

By accessing, forking, contributing to, or otherwise using this repository ("free-steam-games-list"), you agree to these Terms of Use and the MIT License (see [LICENSE](LICENSE) file).

### Key Points:
1. **Use at Your Own Risk:** The content is just a curated list of free-to-play games on Steam. Download/play games entirely at your own discretion and risk.
2. **No Endorsement or Guarantees:** Inclusion in the list does **not** mean I recommend, endorse, or guarantee quality, safety, fairness, or anything. Most are added because they're free – that's it.
3. **Liability? What Liability?** See the DISCLAIMER.md – I'm not responsible for anything. Bad games, wasted time, toxic players, surprise microtransactions – not my problem.
4. **Contributions:** Welcome! Feel free to open PRs to add/remove games, but I might reject if it doesn't fit my chaotic vibe. Follow the MIT License for any code/data you add.
5. **No Commercial Drama:** You can use/fork/modify under MIT rules, but don't blame me if you build something on top and it blows up.
6. **Updates & Maintenance:** Zero promises. I update when I want (see DISCLAIMER for the chaotic schedule).
7. **Governing Law:** Whatever GitHub says, plus common sense. I'm in Vietnam, broke, and not a lawyer.

These terms can change anytime (I'll update the file if I remember). Continued use means you accept changes.

This is overkill for a simple list repo, but hey – better safe than sorry when you're unemployed and paranoid :))

Questions? Issues welcome, but keep it chill.
