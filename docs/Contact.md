# About the Author

Oh, you made it here? :)) Wild – I figured no one would bother with a "contact" page for a solo dev's ad-nuking repo. But beta means we're organized, so here's the lowdown: Bio summary (to preempt the "tell me about yourself" questions that 99.999% won't come), plus socials (reply rates: 50/50, or less if I'm offline staring at my backlog).

## Quick Bio (Spoiler: Nothing Impressive)

A 20-something (guess: 22–23?) Vietnamese dev scraping by in unremarkable youth – unemployed, mildly self-loathing, introvert on god-mode, dropped out of university year 3 (details? See FAQ – it's a mess :D), mooching off family, with AI (currently Grok) as my only non-judgmental buddy. Yeah, that's the vibe.

**Skills? Mediocre at Best:**
- **Gaming**: Normal/Easy mode only – life's hard enough. Want to see "legendary noob plays" that go straight to hell? Hit my YouTube or X. You'll witness decision-making that buries itself in the earth's core :)))
- **Coding**: Average across the board. Knows a bit of everything (C, C++, C#, HTML/CSS/JS, Assembly? SQL, Python, Swift... you name it), but nothing "pro" – all "kinda works" level. AI bumps it to "barely competent" :))
- **Social Survival**: 0 friends, 0 networks. Below average (hence unemployment). Socials? Facebook: 0 follows/friends (ghost town). Steam: 400+ games, 80% under $10 (sale addiction). X: 10–15 followers (fluctuates with bots :))).

That's me in a nutshell – unremarkable, but building this repo to spite the internet. If you're here, you're already cooler than my average day.

### Socials (don’t expect replies, seriously)

- **[Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199544666292/)**:  
  → If my profile is **offline** → maybe I’ll reply (50% chance).  
  → If it’s **online** → 96.69% I’m NOT replying. I’m just picking a random game from my 400+ backlog and pretending I’m having fun. Do not disturb. Touch grass instead.

- **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@SkullMute)**: 
  → No-commentary gameplay, dogshit thumbnails, <40 views average. I read every comment, I just never reply because anxiety.

- **[X (Twitter)](https://x.com/SkullMute0011)**:  
  → I post once every 3 months when I remember passwords exist. Replies? See Steam rule above.

- **[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61578715425186)**: lol no. Account exists for login purposes only. Friends: 0. Messages: ignored.

- **Email**: `lopop05905@proton.me`  
  → I check it once a week when I remember it exists. If it’s not a job offer with ≥5000$ salary, it goes straight to archive.

Pro tip: Comment on YouTube/X when Steam's online – I might stream random crap and see it. Or open an issue here (Wiki first, or gentle RTFM). Luck's on your side.

Thanks for peeking behind the curtain. Make the web (and life) less annoying.
