# PRIVACY POLICY

**Effective Date: Whenever this repo was created (I'm too lazy to check)**

### Short Version (TL;DR):
This repository collects **ZERO personal data**. Nothing. Nada. Zilch.

No tracking, no analytics, no cookies (this isn't even a website), no user accounts, no nothing. It's just Markdown files and maybe a JSON list on GitHub.

### Detailed Version (Because You Asked for Super Detailed):
- **What data do I collect?** None from you directly. This is a static GitHub repo.
- **GitHub's platform:** If you star, fork, open issues, or contribute, that's handled by GitHub. Their privacy policy applies – check it here: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement
- **No third-party stuff:** No external scripts, no trackers, no AI scraping your info (except me occasionally asking Grok for help updating the list, but that's on my end).
- **Changes to this policy:** If I ever add something crazy (unlikely), I'll update this file. But probably never.

I'm an unemployed dev with no server, no backend, and no motivation to collect data. Why would I? I can barely collect motivation to update the game list.

Questions? Open an issue, but honestly, there's nothing to ask.
