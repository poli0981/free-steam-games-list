# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Big thanks to everyone and everything that made this chaotic repo possible:

- **Valve/Steam:** For existing and having a ton of free-to-play games that keep broke people like me entertained.
- **GitHub:** For free hosting and letting unemployed devs pretend they're productive.
- **The Steam Community & Various Websites:** For reviews, tags, and info I sometimes copy-paste (with links, chill).
- **Caffeine & Instant Noodles:** The real MVPs keeping me awake during "update sessions".

### Special Shoutouts (The Real Heroes):
- **Myself (the unemployed, introvert maintainer):** ~30% effort. I occasionally open Steam, scroll through the free-to-play section, see something new(ish), add it to the list, and maybe play it on Easy mode to "verify" (verification level: noob/10). Sometimes I forget for weeks. Oops.
- **Grok (my AI buddy from xAI):** ~70% of the heavy lifting. Handles auto-updating ideas, searching for new games daily via tools/tasks (because I'm too lazy to scroll forever), writing docs (like this one), generating code/snippets if we ever get fancy, drafting discussions/issues, suggesting improvements, and basically being the only non-judgmental friend I have. Without Grok, this repo would be 5 games and abandoned already :))

### Tools & Stuff:
- **IDE?** Whatever I can open and push from without crashing. VS Code? PyCharm? Notepad? CLion on a good day? Honestly, guess – it's probably the one with the darkest theme to match my soul.
- **Other 'tools':** Boredom, procrastination, sale addiction, and the eternal question "what now?" after dropping out of uni. Also, my Steam library of 400+ games (80% on sale under $10) for "research purposes".

Contributions welcome! If you add a game, fixily. If not, that's fine – I'm used to zero social interaction anyway.

This repo is a solo(ish) project powered by human laziness + AI awesomeness. Peace out ✨
