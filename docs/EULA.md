# END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (EULA)

**Wait, what?** This is literally just a curated list of free Steam games on GitHub, licensed under MIT. There is no "software" to install, no executable, no nothing. But since you're here and apparently love legal documents more than free games...

By accessing, viewing, forking, starring, or even thinking about this repository, you agree to the following:

1. **The MIT License is the Real Boss:** Everything is governed by the MIT License (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). That's it. That's the actual legal stuff.
2. **No Actual Product Here:** You're not "using" software – you're reading a Markdown list made by a broke, unemployed dev in his free time (which is all the time).
3. **Your Responsibilities:** 
   - Play games at your own risk.
   - Don't blame me if a game sucks, has microtransactions from hell, or eats your CPU.
   - If something breaks your PC/brain/soul, talk to Valve or the devs – not me.
4. **My Responsibilities:** Zero. Zilch. Nada. I might update the list when bored, or not.
5. **Termination:** If you violate these terms (good luck figuring out how), I reserve the right to... laugh and do nothing, because I'm not a company.
6. **Governing Law:** Vietnam (probably), common sense, and whatever GitHub enforces.

This EULA is mostly a joke because it's overkill for a game list. The real license is MIT – short, sweet, and actually enforceable.

If you're a lawyer reading this: congrats, you've wasted your time. Go play a free game instead.
