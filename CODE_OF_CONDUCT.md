# CODE OF CONDUCT

This repo is a chill spot for broke gamers and noobs like me. We're here to share free Steam games, not drama.

### Our Pledge
Be nice. Or at least civil. We're all unemployed introverts at heart (or pretending to be).

### Standards
- **Be respectful:** No harassment, no toxicity, no personal attacks. This ain't Dota 2 chat.
- **Be helpful:** Suggestions, additions, fixes – yes. Trolling, spam, off-topic rants – no.
- **Be inclusive:** Everyone's welcome, regardless of skill level (especially noobs on Easy mode).
- **No malware/fake links:** Instant ban from contributing. I have trust issues already.
- **Disagreements?** Keep it calm in Issues/PRs. If it gets heated, I'll just close it and go play a game.

### Enforcement
I'm the only maintainer (with Grok as backup), so violations = close issue/PR, block if needed. No appeals – life's too short.

This is based on the Contributor Covenant, but shortened because who reads long docs?

Scope: Everywhere in this repo – Issues, PRs, Discussions.

Thanks for keeping it positive. Now go add some games or play one ✨
