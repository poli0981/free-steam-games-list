# CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES

Thanks for wanting to help! This repo lives because of caffeine, boredom, and occasional contributions. Let's keep it simple and noob-friendly.

### How to Contribute
1. **Fork the repo** → Make changes → Open a Pull Request.
2. **What to add/remove?**
   - New free-to-play games on Steam.
   - Fixes: Broken links, wrong tags, updated reviews, etc.
   - Improvements: Better descriptions, new columns (if useful).

### PR Requirements (Keep it straight to the point – I'm lazy):
- **Game name?** Exact as on Steam.
- **Steam link?** Direct app page (e.g., https://store.steampowered.com/app/123456/Game_Name/).
- **Short description:** 1-2 sentences, genre, why it's worth (or not).
- **Other info:** Rating, notes (multiplayer? toxic? grindy?).
- **NO BULLSHIT:** Fake links, malware, scams, paid games disguised as free → PR rejected + potential block. I have to check manually, don't make me regret opening contributions.

### Template for Adding a Game (copy-paste in PR description):

```text
Game: [Name]
Link: [Steam URL]
Genre: [e.g., FPS, MOBA]
Description: [Short vibe]
Notes: [e.g., Toxic community, Co-op fun, I've played it on Easy]
```

textI'll review when I can (no schedule, see DISCLAIMER.md). If approved, you'll get credit in ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS maybe.

Thanks for making this list less dead than my social life! 🔥
