# Contributing to Awesome Free-to-Play Games on Steam

Yo, thanks for stopping by! This repo is a hobby project by a broke, unemployed Vietnamese dev (20-something, introvert
max level, dropped out uni year 3, mooching off family, Steam library 400+ games 80% under $10 sale addiction).
Powered ~70% by Grok (my AI buddy from xAI) – the only non-judgmental friend keeping this alive while I play Easy mode
only :))

Want to help? Awesome! No strict rules – life's hard enough. Just keep it chill and on-topic.

### How to Contribute (So Easy Bro :)))

1. **Preferred way: Open an Issue**  
   Go to [Issues tab](https://github.com/poli0981/free-steam-games-list/issues/new/choose) – pick a template:
    - ➕ Add New Games (max 15)
    - ➖ Delete Games (max 10)
    - 🐛 Bug Report
    - 💡 Feature Request / Improvement
    - 📢 Feedback / Rant
    - ❓ Off-Topic

   Fill the form – checkboxes, dropdowns, short descriptions. I'll check (lazy but will do) and update data.json/tables
   auto.

2. **Big changes? PR welcome**  
   Fork → edit `scripts/data.json` (add/delete games, notes/safe/genre) or code/scripts.  
   Push → open PR. I'll review when caffeine hits (or Grok reminds me).

3. **Tips for smooth contrib**
    - Games must be real Free-to-Play on Steam (no demos, paid now, virus pls).
    - Notes/safe optional but helpful (e.g., "Toxic max", "Grind phê Easy mode", "Safe y").
    - Spam/off-topic? Ignored by default – good luck :))

Thanks for making this noob repo better! Star if you find a hidden gem, or buy me a coffee
via [FUNDING.yml](.github/FUNDING.yml) to fuel instant noodles + more sale games ✨

Questions? Open an issue – that's contributing too :))
