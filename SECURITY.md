# SECURITY POLICY

### Why does this even exist?
This repo is literally just a Markdown list of free-to-play Steam games + some JSON maybe later. No executable code, no dependencies, no backend, no user data. The biggest security risk is probably adding a game with toxic chat or aggressive microtransactions.

But hey, GitHub recommends it, and I'm paranoid enough after writing all those disclaimers.

### Reporting a Vulnerability
If you somehow find a "security issue" (like a broken link, a game that's actually paid now, or a listing that offends your soul):
- Open an Issue with the title starting with "[SECURITY]" or something.
- Describe it clearly: What game? What link? Why is it bad?
- I'll fix it when I wake up from my nap (or when Grok reminds me).

**Do NOT** report fake/malware links here expecting me to click them – that's on you, bro. Steam's client is your friend.

No bounties, no fame, no money – I'm broke. Just a "thanks" in the ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS if you're lucky.

If it's actually serious (lmao unlikely), email... wait, I don't have one for this. Just open an issue.

Thanks for keeping the list safe-ish. Peace out.
